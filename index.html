                    <div class="column1">
                        <p>This is a website I designed to help me learn how to code better. This will be a fun and interesting process. 
                            Basically, the goal is to create a website that serves as a place to collect and display all of the games that 
                            I will make. Most of the games I make will likely be in java and python. I am hoping that the end product will 
                            not only help me practice, but could also be used to show recruiters that I am able to code in a bunch of different 
                            languages. This is the home page where users can access all of the different games from. I have designed this website 
                            in Figma and then taught myself how to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.</p>

                <h3>Python Spiral</h3>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column1">
                        <p>This first game was written in Python using turtle. This draws an image with the pen tool in turtle. 
                            Essentially what it does is it draws so that it is almost a square, but not quite. Instead of it being 90 degrees. 
                            It turns 89 degrees which gives it that spiral like pattern. The length of the lines also increase by one each time 
                            which is why it gets larger as it goes. Unfortunately, this is less of a game and more of a cool thing to look at 
                            since it is not interactive. Click on the picure to go to the game page!</p>

                    <div class="column1">
                        <p>This second game was written in JavaScript. I followed a tutorial to make this and then made modifications
                            so that I could have the game exactly how I want it, including the ability to reset and restart capabilities 
                            I did this so that I could better learn how to code in 
                            JavaScript so that I could code my own games in JavaScript. Click the image to enter the Flappy Bird Game page.

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column1">
                        <p>This third game was written in JavaScript. I took the information I learned from the past games and coded this 
                            tank game from scratch. The objective of the game is to make sure that the tank does not hit any of the objects 
                            in its way. You can avoid this happening by using the tank gun to fire shots and menuver the shots to hit the
                            objects so that they break before the tank hits them. Click the image to enter the Tank Game page.
