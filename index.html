                        <p>This is a website I designed to help me learn how to code better. This will be a fun and interesting process. 
                            Basically, the goal is to create a website that serves as a place to collect and display all of the games that 
                            I will make. Most of the games I make will likely be in java and python. I am hoping that the end product will 
                            not only help me practice, but could also be used to show recruiters that I am able to code in a bunch of different 
                            languages. This is the home page where users can access all of the different games from. I have designed this website 
                            in Figma and then taught myself how to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.</p>

                        <p>This first game was written in Python using turtle. This draws an image with the pen tool in turtle. 
                            Essentially what it does is it draws so that it is almost a square, but not quite. Instead of it being 90 degrees. 
                            It turns 89 degrees which gives it that spiral like pattern. The length of the lines also increase by one each time 
                            which is why it gets larger as it goes. Unfortunately, this is less of a game and more of a cool thing to look at 
                            since it is not interactive. Click on the picure to go to the game page!</p>
