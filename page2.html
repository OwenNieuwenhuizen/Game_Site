            <h2>Game Description</h2>
            <p>This first game was written in Python using turtle. This draws an image with the pen tool in turtle. Essentially what it does is it draws so that it is almost a square, but not quite. Instead of it being 90 degrees. It turns 89 degrees which gives it that spiral like pattern. The length of the lines also increase by one each time which is why it gets larger as it goes. Unfortunately, this is less of a game and more of a cool thing to look at since it is not interactive. Click on the picure to see it run!</p>
